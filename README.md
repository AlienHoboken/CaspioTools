CaspioTools
===========

CaspioTools is a toolchain for the Caspio Web Services API that is meant to aid in application development speed and robustness when using the Caspio platform. It effectively abstracts away the usage of the Caspio Web Servies API so that you can spend more time developing your application and less time learning a new API system. Further, the CaspioTools toolchain provides additional, useful capabilities such as user logins.
